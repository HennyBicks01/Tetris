## Summary
a Tetris game in Phaser whose background and color palette change with the temperature outside by utilizing the Weatherbit API.

## Technologies
#### Phaser: 
We will be using this to build the game itself, including handling game logic, rendering graphics, and managing user inputs.

#### JavaScript:
This will be the primary programming language used in our game development. this will be what allows us to write interactive game logic and manipulate game elements.

#### HTML5:
HTML5 provides the structure and elements required to embed the Phaser game in a web page. Additionally, this allows for seamless integration and rendering of our game in modern web browsers.

#### Weatherbit API:
The Weatherbit API is a service that allows you to programmatically access weather data. This lets us make HTTP requests to retrieve temperature information based on location.

#### AJAX or Fetch API:
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or the Fetch API are JavaScript techniques used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the Weatherbit API. This allows us to fetch temperature data dynamically within the game.

#### JSON:
The Weatherbit API typically returns weather data in JSON format. Parsing the JSON response allows us to extract the temperature value and utilize it in our game.

#### Color Manipulation:
JavaScript provides various methods for manipulating colors. We can adjust RGB values or apply color filters based on the temperature value to dynamically change our game's color palette.

#### CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to define and control the visual appearance of the Tetris game. By updating CSS properties based on the temperature value, you can change the color scheme of the game dynamically.
